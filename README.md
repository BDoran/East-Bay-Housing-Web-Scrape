# East-Bay-Housing-Web-Scrape

I went ahead and scraped Craigslist rooms/shares and apt categories for the East Bay. I will add the same for SF as well. More EDA to come later on, possibly using NLP to predict price by words used in title, but that's not very practical (just cool!).

Future directions for this project: integrating with the Twilio API to send the URLs of the cheapest posts by desired neighborhood as soon as they are posted, which requires setting up a task scheduler task so that the data is up to date, and then text maybe the URLs for the 3 cheapest or so.
